## Projects:

The goal of each of these porjects was to solve real world problems, beyond just demonstrating technical understanding of each technique. Each project will contain a link to the a file with the full analysis, and where relevent, replicable code templates.

A summary of all projects can be seen below:

-    Stock Portfolio Analysis using Graph Based Cluserting - 172% returns vs SNP500. 
-    Emotion Dection using Convolutional Neural Networks - 87% classification accuracy.
-    Custom Geographical Data Visulation for Agricultural farms - real world implimentation.

### Stock Portfolio Selection Tool - Graph Based Clustering.

![Stock_Returns](assets/img/Stock_Returns_1.png)

   - Graph based clustering based on daily stock returns used to create an optimal stock portfolio selection tool.
   - Hyperparamater tuning dramatically improved model performance from marginal gains over the market to consistenly outperforming the market. 
   - 172% better returns than SNP500 over last 6 years. 
   - 1.5x increase in risk - small vs other models.

![CNN Solution](assets/img/CNN_Solution_2.png)

   - Use Convolutional Neural Networks to classify human emotinos based on images of their faces.
   - 87% Classification accuracy with 97% accuracy on surprised faces, and 93% accuracy on happy faces.
   - Custom model outperfoming transfer learning models such as RESNET in both performance and compute efficiency. 
   - Final Assesment in my M.I.T course recieving full marks. 

**Feedback from assessor:**
"Congratulations on a well-structured and insightful analysis! Your exploration of various neural
network models, emphasis on market trends, and strategic recommendations showcase a robust
understanding of the subject. The incorporation of real-world considerations and future
improvements reflects a forward-thinking approach. Well done!Congratulations on a well-structured and insightful analysis! Your exploration of various neural network models, emphasis on market trends, and strategic recommendations showcase a robust

### Custom Visualisation Tool for Agricultural Farms - Dynamic Charting

![Maps 2](assets/img/Maps_2.png)

   - Takes co-ordinate data to create custom maps in plotly that can then be used for visualising geographic data.
   - Interactive tool that can be saved and exported for use by less technically confident employees.
   - Real life implimentation in agriculture for visualsing field level data on farms. 
   - Replicateable code template that can be easily repurposed for other farms.

## Work:

**Kantar - Research Manager:**

In my current role I'm often working with data and have implimented technical skills and knowledge where relevent to save time, or build new, scaleable products for clients. 
   - Designed, sold and scaled an analysis tool to solve real client needs on understanding drivers of consumer value perceptions with  global implimentation.
   - Creating and using code templates to speed up workflows and increase interpretability of the data, in complex client work. 
   - Build and used code templates create efficneiy in reccuring tasks, reducing a time spent from 1 day per week to 30 minutes.
