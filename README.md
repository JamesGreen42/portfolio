### Stock Portfolio Selection Tool - Graph Based Clustering.

![Stock_Returns](assets/img/Stock_Returns_1.png)

Used graph based clustering to create a statistical model that can identify stock portfolio's that consistently beat market returns. Optimised and applied the model to select portfolios that on average deliver 22% returns over the last 5 years (double the 11% average in the SNP500) with 1.5x increase in risk exposure.
